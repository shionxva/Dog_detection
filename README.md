basic real-time object detection run on CPU with ~20 FPS
- ``YOLOtest.py`` real-time dog detection and indentification using **YOLO model**
- ``MBNv2test.py`` only offer real-time dog breed indentification (other object in frame will cause confusion)
- ``beide.py`` real-time dog detection and indentification using **MobilenetV2 model** (2 models were trained to detect and identify dog breed)
